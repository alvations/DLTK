{"name":"DLTK - Deutsch Language Tool Kit","tagline":"Usable and Useful, Free and Open","body":"### DLTK: Deutsch Language Tool Kit\r\nThe Deutsch Language Tool Kit (DLTK) is an attempt to gather German Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing tools under one _free and open source_ python-able library. Usability and utility of DLTK remains the foremost importance in deriving best of practices for linguistically sound and computationally feasible solution for German NLP preprocessing. \r\n\r\n### Free and Open\r\nWe understand different ethos between the open and free software community but the issue with German NLP tools remain one of **usability and utility**. With regards to licenses, decision is yet to be made, but it will surely maintain the freedom of users and integrity of developers.\r\n\r\n### Usable and User-friendly\r\n\"_Without users, developers built tools in vain. Without developers, users wait in vain for tools._\"\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@alvations is the chief developer of the DLTK. On a side note, DLTK is a part of a more ambitious project to build a crosslingual and extensible tool kit ([XLTK: eXtensible Language Tool Kit](https://github.com/alvations/XLTK)) where scability is the main concern.\r\n\r\nWe seek the collaboration of other German NLP developers to contribute, modify and promote this movement.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
